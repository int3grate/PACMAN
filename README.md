This is a project for a fake "PACMAN" virus / ransomware.  It is intended for use during CTF / Redteam events (for pranking), or could be used for other things like confusing tech support scammers when they remote in.

By default the program doesn't show in the main window of the task manager, you'll have to go to the processes tab to kill it.  The application continually makes itself take focus so it can be somewhat difficult to stop it from running.
